PyNetStim: Brain Network Stimulation in Python
===============================================

pynetstim is aiming to create an integrated framework for brain network stimulation and stimulation targeting.

## Major goal: 

The main goal of pynetstim is to provide a framework for <b> individualizing stimulation sites by integrating computational modeling, multimodal imaging as well as stimulation simulation</b>.


## Minor goals:


There are several minor goals that pynetstim aims to achieve: 

- provide a framework for <b>visualization</b> of : 

	-  stimulation targets on cortical surface 
	-  TMS coil stimulations post TMS session
	-  multimodal maps to guide brain stimulation

- provides a summary of TMS session (stimulation locations, accuracy, ... )
